## Overview

The "Human Face Image Prediction using GAN" project is a Python-based machine learning project that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to predict and generate human face images. This project utilizes the TensorFlow library and is designed to assist in investigations where facial image reconstruction or generation is needed.

## Features

- **GAN-based Image Generation:** The project uses GANs to generate human face image based on input image.
  
- **Training with Sketch and Colored Images:** The model has been trained using a dataset containing both sketch and colored images, enabling it to understand and reconstruct facial features accurately.

## Usage

To use the project:

1. Run the code.
2. The code will generate a sketch image using generator and discriminator and save trained results as a model.
3. Then give test input to test.ipynb file and run the test code to display the predicted image.

## Project Status

Please note that this project is still under development. The current version is a proof of concept and may not produce fully accurate or complete human face images. It is a work in progress, and further development and refinement are needed.

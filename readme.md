# Human Face Image Prediction using GAN


## Overview

The "Human Face Image Prediction using GAN" project is a Python-based machine learning project that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to predict and generate human face images. This project utilizes the TensorFlow library and is designed to assist in investigations where facial image reconstruction or generation is needed.

## Features

- **GAN-based Image Generation:** The project uses GANs to generate human face images based on input parameters.
  
- **Training with Sketch and Colored Images:** The model has been trained using a dataset containing both sketch and colored images, enabling it to understand and reconstruct facial features accurately.

- **User-Interactive Face Generation:** The code prompts the user to describe the desired facial features, such as face shape, lips, hairstyle, etc. It then generates a sketch image based on the user's input.

- **Speech Recognition:** The project incorporates speech recognition to facilitate user input, making it user-friendly and accessible.

## Usage

To use the project:

1. Run the code.
2. The code will prompt you to describe the facial features you want in the generated image.
3. Provide details such as face shape (round or v-shaped), lip features, hairstyle, etc.
4. The code will generate a sketch image based on your input.

## Project Status

Please note that this project is still under development. The current version is a proof of concept and may not produce fully accurate or complete human face images. It is a work in progress, and further development and refinement are needed.
